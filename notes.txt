1. Single Tier Applications
- A single-tier application is an application where the user interface, backend business logic & the database all reside in the same machine.
- The main upside of single-tier applications is they have no network latency since every component is located on the same machine. This adds up to the performance of the software.

2. Two Tier Application 
- A Two-tier application involves a client and a server. The client would contain the user interface & the business logic in one machine. And the backend server would be the database running on a different machine. The database server is hosted by the business & has control over it.

3. Three Tier Applications
- In a three-tier application, the user interface, application logic & the database all lie on different machines & thus have different tiers. They are physically separated.
